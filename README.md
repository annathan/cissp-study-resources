My personal CISSP study journey — the resources I used, how I rated them, and the mindset tips that helped me pass.


# CISSP Study Resources – My Recommendations

Over the years, I’ve had a lot of people ask me how I prepared for the CISSP.  
I’ve always shared the same list because it worked for me, and I still think it’s a solid roadmap today.  

This repo pulls together the resources I used, my honest ratings, and some mindset notes that helped me pass.  
Nothing here is proprietary or exam content, just publicly available resources and my perspective.

## 📚 Resources I Used

### Textbooks and Guides
- **Complete CISSP CBK Textbook** – **2/10**  
  Too big, too dense, not practical for most people.  
- **Sybex Edition 8 Study Guide** – **8/10**  
  Comprehensive, but very dry and hard to read.  

### Videos and Courses
- **Mike Chapple (LinkedIn Learning)** – **7/10**  
  He literally wrote the Sybex guide, so he knows the material, but his delivery is as dry as the book.  
- **Kelly Handerhan (Free on YouTube)** – **10/10**  
  Outstanding explanations. I watched everything and took tonnes of notes.  
- **Kelly Handerhan – "Why You Will Pass"** – **9/10**  
  Mindset is half the battle. I watched this on the way to the exam.  

### Notes and Tips
- **Organized Sunflower CISSP Notes** – **10/10**  
  The best distilled written notes I found.  
- **Larry Greenblatt CISSP Exam Tips** – **10/10**  
  His explanation of how exam questions are worded was a game-changer.

## 🎧 Mindset and Exam Day

- On the morning of the exam, I watched Kelly Handerhan’s “Why You Will Pass” video. It genuinely calmed me down and focused me on the *way* to think.  
- Sitting in the car park before I went in, YouTube randomly served me this video: [link](https://youtu.be/FHuzohDiD50). It reinforced how important it is to focus on *how* the questions are worded, not just the content. That helped me crack a few tricky ones.

## 📝 Key Takeaways

- Don’t just study facts, study how the exam is written.  
- Use multiple formats (reading, video, notes) so it sticks.  
- Focus on the **CISSP mindset**: think like a manager, not a technician.
